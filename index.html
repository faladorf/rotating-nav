      <p>To Alma Mater all be loyal, keep her name in purest light. 

        Never waver from her precepts, guard her banner blue and white. 
        
        O sing her praise to highest skies and be ye faithful in her eyes, for she will foster all your dreams, her name is Seton Hall. 
        
        When on life's hard stones you stumble, pray to God to be your guide. 
        
        Think of Seton Hall your mother, then forge on in steady stride. 
        
        O sing her praise to highest skies, and be ye faithful in her eyes, for she will foster all your dreams, her name is Seton Hall.

      <p>Established in 1856, Seton Hall Preparatory School is a Catholic, college-preparatory school called to educate young men of diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. Firmly rooted in our Catholic identity and rich tradition, our mission is to foster the spiritual, intellectual, social and physical growth of our students. We do this in order to prepare them to meet the challenges of college and adulthood in a manner that embodies the values of spiritual awareness, academic excellence, personal maturity, and social responsibility with a particular emphasis on serving others.</p>
